Java produces applets (browser-run programs), which facilitate graphical user interface (GUI) and object interaction 
by Internet users. Prior to Java applets, Web pages were typically static Java is a programming language that produces 
software for multiple platforms. When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) 
runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Java derives much of its syntax from the C 
and C++ programming languages. Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist 
with Sun Microsystems.and non-interactive. Java applets have diminished in popularity with the release of 
competing products,  Silverlight. Java applets run in a Web browser with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
which translates Java bytecode into native processor instructions and allows indirect OS or platform program 
execution. JVM provides the majority of components needed to run bytecode, which is usually smaller than executable 
programs written through other programming languages. Bytecode cannot run if a system lacks required JVM. Java program 
development requires a Java software development kit (SDK) that typically includes a compiler, interpreter, 
documentation generator and other tools used to produce a complete application. Development time may be 
accelerated through the use of integrated development environments (IDE) - such as JBuilder, Netbeans, 
Eclipse or JCreator. IDEs facilitate the development of GUIs, which include buttons, text boxes, panels, 
frames, scrollbars and other objects via drag-and-drop and point-and-click actions. Java programs are 
found in desktops, servers, mobile devices, smart cards and Blu-ray Discs (BD).
